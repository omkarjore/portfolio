## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Secure CAD automation developer position or freelance contracts within 60 days
- Create memorable "next-level developer" impression through interactive 3D demonstrations
- Demonstrate real client impact (40% time reduction, 50+ drawings automated for THERMAX/L&T/PRAJ)
- Provide recruiters complete information (skills, education, contact) without external searches
- Achieve mobile-first experience functional on 90%+ of Android/iOS devices
- Complete MVP build in 2 hours or less with $0 hosting costs
- Differentiate from generic portfolios through portfolio-as-product-demo approach

### Background Context

Traditional CAD automation specialist portfolios fail to communicate technical sophistication effectively. Text-heavy descriptions and static screenshots don't convey the complexity of Autodesk API integration, P&ID automation, or Navisworks development. Non-technical recruiters struggle to understand the value proposition, leading to missed opportunities for qualified candidates. With 5-6 years of specialized experience and proven client impact, Omkar needs a portfolio that immediately demonstrates capabilities through interactive 3D visualizations rather than just describing them.

This 3D interactive portfolio addresses the problem by immersing visitors directly into working demonstrations of CAD automation projects. The centerpiece Thermax SmartPID automation project showcases quantified business impact, while traditional portfolio sections ensure recruiters have all necessary information for follow-up. Built with aggressive 2-hour timeline and zero-cost hosting constraints, the solution leverages React Three Fiber, Vercel, and mobile-first design principles.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

**Immediate Immersion Experience:** Visitors land directly into the 3D scene without a traditional landing page, establishing an immediate "next-level developer" impression. The experience prioritizes demonstration over explanationâ€”recruiters explore interactive project cards in a unified 3D space rather than reading static descriptions.

**Frictionless Navigation:** The interface minimizes cognitive load through intuitive scroll-based 3D navigation (no complex controls to learn) and an always-accessible menu for traditional sections. The 3D experience serves as the "hub" with clear pathways to detailed information.

**Progressive Disclosure:** Project cards present high-level information at a glance, expanding on interaction to reveal detailed metrics, technology stacks, and links. Traditional portfolio sections are accessible but non-intrusive, ensuring visitors can find necessary information without overwhelming the initial experience.

**Performance-First Mobile Design:** The mobile experience is not a degraded desktop version but a thoughtfully optimized experience with touch-friendly interactions, reduced visual complexity where needed, and acceptable performance (30+ FPS) on modern smartphones.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

**Scroll-Based 3D Navigation:**
- Natural scrolling moves camera through 3D space (familiar web interaction applied to 3D)
- No keyboard controls or complex joystick metaphors required
- Mouse wheel on desktop, swipe gesture on mobile

**Click/Tap to Expand:**
- Project cards respond to hover states (desktop) showing interactivity cues
- Click/tap expands card to reveal detailed project information
- Close button or click outside returns to gallery view

**Touch Gestures (Mobile-Specific):**
- Single-finger swipe: Navigate through 3D space
- Tap: Select/expand project card
- Pinch-to-zoom: Optional enhancement (not MVP)

**Menu-Driven Traditional Navigation:**
- Hamburger menu or floating button always visible
- Clicking menu overlays or transitions to traditional sections
- "Return to 3D" button prominently placed in traditional sections

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

**Decision:** Single repository containing all portfolio code, assets, and documentation.

**Rationale:**
- Simplicity for solo developer (no coordination across multiple repos)
- Faster development (all code in one place supports 2-hour timeline)
- Easy deployment (single repo deploys directly to Vercel/Netlify)
- Documentation co-location (docs alongside code)

**Structure:**
```
portfolio/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/              # Static assets (resume PDF, images, headshot)
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 3d/         # Three.js components (Scene, ProjectCard, Camera)
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ui/         # Traditional UI (About, Skills, Contact, etc.)
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ layout/     # Navigation, Layout wrappers
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages/          # Route components (if using routing)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/          # Custom React hooks
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ utils/          # Helper functions
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ App.jsx         # Main app component
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/               # Project documentation
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

### Service Architecture: Static Site (JAMstack) - Monolith Frontend

**Decision:** Client-side rendered React application with static asset serving. No backend, no microservices, no server-side rendering.

**Rationale:**
- **Zero Cost Hosting:** Static sites deploy free on Vercel/Netlify
- **Maximum Performance:** Pre-built assets served from global CDN
- **MVP Simplicity:** No backend eliminates authentication, database, API complexity
- **Fast Build Time:** Entire portfolio builds in seconds, deploys automatically
- **No Server Management:** Fully managed hosting, no infrastructure concerns

**Architecture Details:**
- **Client-Side Only:** All logic runs in browser (React + Three.js)
- **Static Asset Serving:** Resume PDF, images served directly from CDN
- **External Links:** GitHub, LinkedIn, email handled via external URLs
- **Future Consideration:** Serverless functions for contact form submission if needed post-MVP

### Testing Requirements: Manual Testing Only (MVP)

**Decision:** No automated test suite for MVP. Manual testing on desktop Chrome/Firefox/Safari and mobile iOS/Android devices only.

**Rationale:**
- **2-Hour Constraint:** Writing tests would consume 30-50% of timeline
- **Simple Codebase:** Portfolio logic is straightforward, low bug risk
- **Visual Validation:** 3D effects require manual visual inspection anyway
- **Post-MVP Enhancement:** Unit tests can be added in Phase 2

**Manual Testing Checklist (MVP Launch):**
- [ ] 3D scene renders correctly on desktop (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- [ ] 3D scene renders correctly on mobile (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
- [ ] Project cards expand/collapse correctly
- [ ] Navigation menu functions on desktop and mobile
- [ ] All traditional sections display correct content
- [ ] Resume PDF downloads successfully
- [ ] External links (GitHub, LinkedIn, email) work correctly
- [ ] Touch gestures work on mobile devices
- [ ] No console errors or broken functionality
- [ ] Performance: Desktop 60 FPS, Mobile 30+ FPS

**Future Testing (Phase 2):**
- Unit tests with Jest/Vitest
- Component tests with React Testing Library
- Visual regression tests (Percy, Chromatic)
- E2E tests with Playwright or Cypress
- Performance monitoring with Lighthouse CI

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

2. **React Three Fiber (@react-three/fiber) + drei (@react-three/drei)**
   - Declarative 3D in React, excellent documentation, active community
   - Alternative Considered: Vanilla Three.js (steeper learning curve, doesn't fit 2-hour timeline)
   - **Critical Assumption:** Developer can learn R3F basics within 1 hour using tutorials

3. **Tailwind CSS**
   - Rapid styling, utility-first approach, responsive design out-of-box
   - Alternative Considered: Styled-components or vanilla CSS (slower development)

4. **Framer Motion or GSAP**
   - Loading animation and transitions
   - Decision Point: Choose based on simpler API (lean toward Framer Motion for React integration)

5. **React Hook Form (Optional - post-MVP if contact form added)**
   - Lightweight, performant form validation
   - MVP Note: Contact section uses simple mailto: links

**Build Tool & Development Environment:**

6. **Vite**
   - Fast dev server, instant HMR, optimized production builds
   - Alternative: Create React App (deprecated/slower) or Next.js (overkill for static site)
   - **Critical for Timeline:** Vite setup is ~5 minutes

**Hosting & Deployment:**

7. **Vercel (Primary) or Netlify (Backup)**
   - Free tier generous (100GB bandwidth/month)
   - Automatic deployments from GitHub
   - Built-in CDN, zero config
   - Automatic HTTPS via Let's Encrypt
   - Custom domain optional ($12/year)

   - Desktop: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+ (95%+ coverage)
   - Mobile: iOS Safari 14+, Android Chrome 90+
   - Fallback: Display message for unsupported browsers

10. **No Polyfills or Legacy Browser Support**
    - Modern browser requirement eliminates need for polyfills
    - Reduces bundle size, faster load times

**Performance Optimization:**

11. **Code Splitting & Lazy Loading (Built-in to Vite)**
    - Automatic code splitting by Vite
    - Lazy load routes/sections if needed

12. **Asset Optimization**
    - Images: WebP format where supported, fallback to PNG/JPG
    - 3D Models: Low-polygon geometric primitives (boxes, spheres)
    - Bundle Size Target: <500KB initial JS bundle

13. **No State Management Library (Redux, Zustand)**
    - React useState/useContext sufficient for minimal state needs
    - Avoids learning curve and additional dependencies

**Content Management:**

14. **Hardcoded Content (No CMS)**
    - Portfolio content is static, rarely changes
    - Content stored in React components or separate JSON file
    - Future: Could migrate to headless CMS if content updates frequent

**Analytics & Monitoring (Post-MVP):**

15. **No Analytics in MVP**
    - GDPR-friendly by default
    - Phase 2: Add privacy-friendly analytics (Plausible, Simple Analytics)

**Accessibility:**

16. **Basic Semantic HTML Only (MVP)**
    - Meets NFR6/NFR7
    - 3D experience may not be fully keyboard-navigable in MVP
    - Phase 2: Enhanced keyboard navigation, ARIA labels

**Security:**

17. **React XSS Protection (Built-in)**
    - React escapes all content by default

18. **No Sensitive Data Storage**
    - All content is public, no cookies, no localStorage with sensitive info

19. **HTTPS Only**
    - Vercel/Netlify provide automatic SSL

**Critical Dependencies:**

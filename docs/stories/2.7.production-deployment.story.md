# Story 2.7: Production Deployment to Vercel/Netlify

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to deploy the portfolio to production hosting,

## Acceptance Criteria

1. GitHub repository pushed with all code and assets
2. Vercel or Netlify account created (free tier)

5. Initial deployment successful, site accessible via provided URL (e.g., `omkarjore.vercel.app`)
6. Automatic deployments configured: pushing to `main` branch triggers new deployment
7. HTTPS enabled automatically (SSL certificate active)
8. Build logs reviewed, no errors or critical warnings
9. Production site tested:
   - 3D scene loads and renders correctly
   - All navigation links work
   - All traditional sections display correctly
   - Resume downloads successfully
   - External links (LinkedIn, GitHub, email) functional
10. Production URL shared and verified accessible from external network

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Complete portfolio MVP"

   ```

2. **Create Vercel Account:**
   - Go to vercel.com
   - Sign up with GitHub

3. **Import Project:**
   - Click "New Project"
   - Select GitHub repository
   - Configure build settings:
     - Framework Preset: Vite
     - Build Command: `npm run build`
     - Output Directory: `dist`

4. **Deploy:**
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Wait for build to complete
   - Access via provided URL (e.g., `portfolio-xxx.vercel.app`)

5. **Custom Domain (Optional):**
   - Add custom domain in Vercel settings
   - Update DNS records

### Build Configuration Verification

**package.json scripts:**
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "tsc && vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview"
  }
}
```

**Vercel Configuration (vercel.json - optional):**
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "devCommand": "npm run dev",
  "installCommand": "npm install"
}
```

### Production Testing Checklist

# Story 2.7: Production Deployment to Vercel/Netlify

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to deploy the portfolio to production hosting,
**so that** it's accessible via public URL and can be shared with recruiters.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. GitHub repository pushed with all code and assets
2. Vercel or Netlify account created (free tier)
3. Portfolio connected to hosting platform (linked to GitHub repo)
4. Build configuration verified (Vite build command: `npm run build`, output directory: `dist`)
5. Initial deployment successful, site accessible via provided URL (e.g., `omkarjore.vercel.app`)
6. Automatic deployments configured: pushing to `main` branch triggers new deployment
7. HTTPS enabled automatically (SSL certificate active)
8. Build logs reviewed, no errors or critical warnings
9. Production site tested:
   - 3D scene loads and renders correctly
   - All navigation links work
   - All traditional sections display correctly
   - Resume downloads successfully
   - External links (LinkedIn, GitHub, email) functional
10. Production URL shared and verified accessible from external network

   - Access via provided URL (e.g., `portfolio-xxx.vercel.app`)

5. **Custom Domain (Optional):**

   - Update DNS records

### Build Configuration Verification

    "build": "tsc && vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview"
  }
}
```

**Vercel Configuration (vercel.json - optional):**
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",

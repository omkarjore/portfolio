# Story 1.2: Basic 3D Scene with Camera and Lighting

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** visitor,
**I want** to see a functional 3D scene when the portfolio loads,
**so that** I immediately understand this is an interactive 3D experience.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `src/components/3d/Scene.jsx` component created using React Three Fiber `<Canvas>`
2. Scene renders without console errors or warnings
3. Default camera positioned at `[0, 0, 5]` looking at origin
4. Ambient light added with intensity 0.5 for base illumination
5. Directional light added at `[10, 10, 5]` with intensity 0.8 for shadows/depth
6. Simple test geometry (sphere or box) rendered at origin to verify 3D rendering works
7. Background color set to appropriate theme color (dark or light)
8. Scene fills entire viewport (100vw x 100vh)
9. Canvas configured with `camera={{ position: [0, 0, 5], fov: 75 }}`
10. 3D scene renders at 60 FPS on desktop Chrome (verified with browser performance tools)

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Create Scene component with React Three Fiber Canvas (AC: 1, 8, 9)
  - [ ] Create file `src/components/3d/Scene.tsx`
  - [ ] Import Canvas from @react-three/fiber
  - [ ] Configure Canvas with camera settings: `camera={{ position: [0, 0, 5], fov: 75 }}`
  - [ ] Set Canvas to fill viewport with className: `w-full h-full`
  - [ ] Verify Scene component structure follows architecture standards

- [ ] Create Lights component for scene illumination (AC: 4, 5)
  - [ ] Create file `src/components/3d/Lights.tsx`
  - [ ] Add ambientLight with intensity 0.5
  - [ ] Add directionalLight at position [10, 10, 5] with intensity 0.8
  - [ ] Export Lights component

- [ ] Add test geometry to verify 3D rendering (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Add a mesh with boxGeometry or sphereGeometry at origin [0, 0, 0]
  - [ ] Apply meshStandardMaterial with color (e.g., '#3b82f6')
  - [ ] Verify geometry is visible from default camera position
  - [ ] Add optional rotation animation using useFrame to confirm scene is active

- [ ] Configure scene background and styling (AC: 7)
  - [ ] Set Canvas background color to theme-appropriate color
  - [ ] Use Tailwind color from theme (e.g., bg-gray-900 or bg-gray-50)
  - [ ] Ensure background provides good contrast for 3D objects

- [ ] Integrate Scene into App.tsx (AC: 2, 8)
  - [ ] Import Scene component in App.tsx
  - [ ] Replace default Vite welcome content with Scene
  - [ ] Ensure App container has full viewport height (h-screen)
  - [ ] Verify no console errors or warnings

- [ ] Test performance and rendering (AC: 2, 10)
  - [ ] Open Chrome DevTools Performance tab
  - [ ] Record scene rendering
  - [ ] Verify 60 FPS frame rate
  - [ ] Check console for any Three.js warnings
  - [ ] Test in Firefox and Safari for cross-browser compatibility

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 1.1 Completion]

Story 1.1 established:
- Vite + React + TypeScript project structure
- React Three Fiber (@react-three/fiber), drei, and Three.js installed
- Project folder structure with `src/components/3d/` directory created
- Development server running successfully

**Key Learnings for Story 1.2:**
- TypeScript is configured and all components must use .tsx extension
- React Three Fiber and Three.js are installed and ready to use
- Tailwind CSS is configured with custom theme colors

### 3D Component Architecture
[Source: docs/ui-architecture.md#Component Standards]

**3D Component Template:**
```typescript
// src/components/3d/Example3D.tsx

import React, { useRef } from 'react';
import { useFrame } from '@react-three/fiber';
import * as THREE from 'three';

interface Example3DProps {
  position?: [number, number, number];
  color?: string;
  onClick?: () => void;
}

export const Example3D: React.FC<Example3DProps> = ({
  position = [0, 0, 0],
  color = '#00ff00',
  onClick
}) => {
  const meshRef = useRef<THREE.Mesh>(null);

  // Animation loop (if needed)
  useFrame((state, delta) => {
    if (meshRef.current) {
      meshRef.current.rotation.y += delta * 0.5;
    }
  });

  return (
    <mesh ref={meshRef} position={position} onClick={onClick}>
      <boxGeometry args={[1, 1, 1]} />
      <meshStandardMaterial color={color} />
    </mesh>
  );
};
```

**Critical 3D Component Rules:**
[Source: docs/ui-architecture.md#Critical Component Rules]

MUST DO:
- ✅ Always use TypeScript with .tsx extension
- ✅ Use functional components with hooks
- ✅ Import React: `import React from 'react'`
- ✅ Use named exports: `export const ComponentName`
- ✅ Keep 3D components in `src/components/3d/`
- ✅ Always use `useRef` for mesh references
- ✅ Use `useFrame` for animations

MUST NOT DO:
- ❌ Never use default exports
- ❌ Never mix 3D and UI logic in same component
- ❌ Never mutate refs directly in render

### Scene Component Structure
[Source: docs/ui-architecture.md#Project Structure]

**File Location:** `src/components/3d/Scene.tsx`

**Canvas Configuration:**
```typescript
import { Canvas } from '@react-three/fiber';

<Canvas
  camera={{ position: [0, 0, 5], fov: 75 }}
  className="w-full h-full"
>
  {/* 3D content goes here */}
</Canvas>
```

**Key Canvas Properties:**
- `camera`: Configure default camera position and field of view
- `className`: Tailwind classes for full viewport coverage
- Canvas automatically sets up WebGL renderer and scene

### Lighting Setup
[Source: docs/ui-architecture.md#Story 1.2 Scene Setup]

**Ambient Light:**
- Purpose: Base illumination for all objects
- Intensity: 0.5 (soft overall lighting)
- Usage: `<ambientLight intensity={0.5} />`

**Directional Light:**
- Purpose: Create shadows and depth perception
- Position: [10, 10, 5] (above and to the side)
- Intensity: 0.8 (strong directional lighting)
- Usage: `<directionalLight position={[10, 10, 5]} intensity={0.8} />`

### Theme Colors
[Source: docs/ui-architecture.md#Tailwind Configuration]

**Available Theme Colors:**
- Primary: `#3b82f6` (blue-500)
- Accent: `#06b6d4` (cyan-500)
- Background: `#f9fafb` (gray-50) or `#111827` (gray-900)

Use Tailwind classes or apply colors directly to materials.

### Performance Requirements
[Source: docs/prd.md#Non-Functional Requirements]

**NFR1:** 60 FPS on desktop browsers (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+)

**Testing Performance:**
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Performance tab
3. Click Record, let scene run for 3-5 seconds
4. Stop recording
5. Check FPS in the frame rate chart (should consistently show 60 FPS)

### Component File Locations
[Source: docs/ui-architecture.md#File Naming Conventions]

- Scene.tsx: `src/components/3d/Scene.tsx`
- Lights.tsx: `src/components/3d/Lights.tsx`
- Components use PascalCase with .tsx extension
- All 3D components must be in `src/components/3d/` directory

### Testing
**Testing Standards:**
[Source: docs/ui-architecture.md#Testing Requirements]

- Manual testing only for MVP
- Focus on visual verification and performance
- Check browser console for errors/warnings
- Test in multiple browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- Use Chrome Performance tools to verify 60 FPS
- No automated test files needed for this story

**Key Test Points:**
1. Scene renders without errors
2. Test geometry is visible
3. Lighting creates visible shadows/depth
4. Performance maintains 60 FPS
5. Scene fills entire viewport

# Story 2.6: Mobile-Responsive Layout and Touch Controls

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** mobile visitor,
**I want** the portfolio to function smoothly on my smartphone with touch gestures,
**so that** I can explore the 3D experience and read content on any device.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. 3D scene renders correctly on mobile viewports (tested on iOS Safari 14+, Android Chrome 90+)
2. Touch gestures implemented for 3D navigation:
   - Single-finger swipe up/down: Navigate through 3D space (equivalent to scroll)
   - Tap on project card: Expand card detail view
3. 3D scene maintains minimum 30 FPS on modern smartphones (iPhone 12+, recent Android flagships)
4. Project card expanded view readable on mobile (text not too small, buttons tappable)
5. Navigation menu accessible on mobile (hamburger icon tappable, menu slides in)
6. All traditional sections (About, Skills, Education, Awards, Contact) responsive on mobile:
   - Text reflows correctly (no horizontal scroll)
   - Images scale appropriately
   - Buttons and links are touch-friendly (minimum 44x44px tap targets)
7. Resume download works on mobile devices
8. External links (LinkedIn, GitHub, mailto) work correctly on mobile
9. "Return to 3D Experience" button visible and functional on mobile
10. Mobile viewport meta tag configured correctly: `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`

## Dev Notes

### Viewport Meta Tag
```html
<!-- index.html -->
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```

### Touch Gestures for 3D
- React Three Fiber handles touch events automatically
- Swipe gestures work with existing scroll implementation
- Tap on meshes works with onClick handlers

### Mobile Testing Checklist
1. ✅ 3D scene renders (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
2. ✅ Touch swipe navigates 3D space
3. ✅ Tap cards to expand
4. ✅ 30+ FPS on iPhone 12+
5. ✅ Modal text readable
6. ✅ Hamburger menu tappable
7. ✅ All sections responsive (no horizontal scroll)
8. ✅ Buttons min 44x44px
9. ✅ Resume downloads
10. ✅ External links work

### Responsive Tailwind Classes
- Use: `flex-col md:flex-row` for mobile-first layouts
- Use: `text-base md:text-lg` for responsive typography
- Use: `p-4 md:p-8` for responsive spacing
- Ensure tap targets: `min-w-[44px] min-h-[44px]`

### Testing
- Test on real iOS device (iPhone)
- Test on real Android device
- Use Chrome DevTools mobile emulation
- Test touch gestures
- Verify 30 FPS with DevTools

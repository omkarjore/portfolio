### Navigation Link Implementation
[Source: Story 1.8 - Navigation Component]

**Update Navigation.tsx About Link:**
```typescript
// src/components/layout/Navigation.tsx

<button
  onClick={() => {
    setCurrentView('about');
    toggleMenu();
  }}
  className="text-left text-lg text-gray-300 hover:text-cyan-400 transition-colors"
>
  About Me
</button>
```

### App.tsx Routing Integration
[Source: docs/ui-architecture.md#Routing]

**Add About to App.tsx:**
```typescript
// src/App.tsx

import { About } from './components/ui/About';

// In return statement:
{currentView === 'about' && (
  <div className="w-full h-full overflow-y-auto bg-gray-50">
    <About />
  </div>
)}
```

### Headshot Photo Handling
[Source: AC 3, 7]

**If Photo Available:**
- Save as `public/headshot.jpg` or `public/headshot.png`
- Professional quality (clear, well-lit, professional attire)
- Recommended size: 500x500px minimum
- Format: JPG or PNG

**If No Photo:**
- Use placeholder SVG icon (user silhouette)
- Add note: "Photo placeholder - add headshot.jpg to public folder"
- Photo can be added later without code changes

**Image Implementation:**
```typescript
{/* With photo */}
<img
  src="/headshot.jpg"
  alt="Omkar Jore - C# .NET Developer"
  className="w-full h-full object-cover"
/>

{/* Without photo (placeholder) */}
<div className="w-full h-full flex items-center justify-center text-gray-400">
  <svg className="w-24 h-24" fill="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 20 20">
    <path fillRule="evenodd" d="M10 9a3 3 0 100-6 3 3 0 000 6zm-7 9a7 7 0 1114 0H3z" clipRule="evenodd" />
  </svg>
</div>
```

### Return to 3D Experience Button

**Button Implementation:**
```typescript
<button
  onClick={() => setCurrentView('home')}
  className="flex items-center text-cyan-600 hover:text-cyan-700 transition-colors font-semibold"
>
  <svg className="w-5 h-5 mr-2" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
    <path strokeLinecap="round" strokeLinejoin="round" strokeWidth={2} d="M10 19l-7-7m0 0l7-7m-7 7h18" />
  </svg>
  Return to 3D Experience
</button>
```

### Responsive Layout

**Desktop Viewports:**
- 1920px: max-width container, comfortable spacing
- 1440px: max-width container, optimized spacing
- 1024px: slightly narrower, maintained readability

**Tailwind Responsive Classes:**
```typescript
<div className="flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-8">
  {/* Photo left on desktop, top on smaller screens */}
</div>

<div className="max-w-4xl mx-auto">
  {/* Constrained width for readability */}
</div>

<div className="p-8 md:p-12">
  {/* More padding on larger screens */}
</div>

# Story 1.4: Scroll-Based Camera Navigation

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** visitor,
**I want** to navigate through the 3D space by scrolling,
**so that** I can explore the project cards using familiar web interactions.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `src/components/3d/CameraController.jsx` component created managing camera position
2. Scroll events captured using React event handlers or drei's `<ScrollControls>`
3. Scrolling down moves camera forward (decreasing Z position), scrolling up moves backward
4. Camera movement smoothly interpolated (lerp) to avoid jarring jumps
5. Scroll range bounded: camera cannot move behind cards or infinitely far away
6. Camera maintains focus on card area (Y position remains centered)
7. Scroll behavior feels natural and responsive (16ms frame time target)
8. Mouse wheel scroll on desktop works correctly
9. Scroll navigation tested on Chrome, Firefox, Safari without issues
10. No scroll jank or dropped frames during camera movement

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Stories 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 Completion]

**Story 1.1 established:**
- Vite + React + TypeScript project
- All dependencies installed

**Story 1.2 established:**
- Scene.tsx with Canvas and camera at [0, 0, 5]
- Camera configuration: `camera={{ position: [0, 0, 5], fov: 75 }}`
- Lighting system in place

**Story 1.3 established:**
- Three ProjectCard components at [-3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0]
- Hover and floating animations working
- 60 FPS performance with cards

**Key Learnings for Story 1.4:**
- Camera currently static at [0, 0, 5]
- Cards are positioned in 3D space and ready to be explored
- Performance baseline established at 60 FPS
- Need to control camera position dynamically via scroll

### Camera Control in React Three Fiber
[Source: docs/ui-architecture.md#3D Component Standards]

**Accessing Camera in R3F:**
- Use `useThree` hook to access camera
- Camera ref available from Three.js scene
- Update camera position in useFrame

**Example:**
```typescript
import { useThree, useFrame } from '@react-three/fiber';

const { camera } = useThree();

useFrame(() => {
  // Update camera position
  camera.position.z = targetZ;
});
```

### Scroll Event Handling Options

**Option 1: Native Wheel Events**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const handleWheel = (event: WheelEvent) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    const delta = event.deltaY;
    // Update scroll position based on delta
  };

  window.addEventListener('wheel', handleWheel, { passive: false });
  return () => window.removeEventListener('wheel', handleWheel);
}, []);
```

**Option 2: drei ScrollControls (Recommended)**
[Source: docs/ui-architecture.md#Frontend Tech Stack - drei]

drei provides `<ScrollControls>` component for easier scroll management:
```typescript
import { ScrollControls, useScroll } from '@react-three/drei';

// In Scene.tsx:
<ScrollControls pages={3} damping={0.1}>
  {/* 3D content */}
</ScrollControls>

// In CameraController:
const scroll = useScroll();
useFrame(() => {
  const offset = scroll.offset; // 0 to 1
  camera.position.z = 8 - (offset * 6); // 8 to 2
});
```

**Recommendation:** Use native wheel events for simpler implementation and direct control for MVP.

### Smooth Camera Movement (Lerp)

**Linear Interpolation (lerp):**
```typescript
const lerp = (start: number, end: number, factor: number): number => {
  return start + (end - start) * factor;
};

// In useFrame:
camera.position.z = lerp(camera.position.z, targetZ, 0.1);
```

**Lerp Factor:**
- 0.05: Slower, smoother movement
- 0.1: Balanced (recommended for responsive feel)
- 0.2: Faster, snappier movement

### Scroll Bounds Calculation

**Camera Position Constraints:**
- Starting position: Z = 5 (from Story 1.2)
- Closest position: Z = 2 (close to cards, still visible)
- Farthest position: Z = 8 (cards still visible but smaller)
- Range: 6 units (8 - 2)

**Scroll Delta Mapping:**
```typescript
const MIN_Z = 2;
const MAX_Z = 8;
const SCROLL_SENSITIVITY = 0.01;

const handleScroll = (deltaY: number) => {
  targetZ += deltaY * SCROLL_SENSITIVITY;
  targetZ = Math.max(MIN_Z, Math.min(MAX_Z, targetZ)); // Clamp
};
```

### CameraController Component Structure

**File Location:** `src/components/3d/CameraController.tsx`

**Component Template:**
```typescript
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';
import { useThree, useFrame } from '@react-three/fiber';

export const CameraController: React.FC = () => {
  const { camera } = useThree();
  const targetZ = useRef(5); // Initial camera Z position

  const MIN_Z = 2;
  const MAX_Z = 8;
  const SCROLL_SENSITIVITY = 0.01;
  const LERP_FACTOR = 0.1;

  useEffect(() => {
    const handleWheel = (event: WheelEvent) => {
      event.preventDefault();

      // Update target Z based on scroll delta
      targetZ.current += event.deltaY * SCROLL_SENSITIVITY;

      // Clamp within bounds
      targetZ.current = Math.max(MIN_Z, Math.min(MAX_Z, targetZ.current));
    };

    window.addEventListener('wheel', handleWheel, { passive: false });
    return () => window.removeEventListener('wheel', handleWheel);
  }, []);

  useFrame(() => {
    // Smooth interpolation (lerp)
    camera.position.z += (targetZ.current - camera.position.z) * LERP_FACTOR;
  });

  return null; // This component doesn't render anything
};
```

### Helper Utility Functions
[Source: docs/ui-architecture.md#Project Structure]

**File Location:** `src/utils/math.ts`

**Math Utilities:**
```typescript
// src/utils/math.ts

/**
 * Linear interpolation between two values
 */
export const lerp = (start: number, end: number, factor: number): number => {
  return start + (end - start) * factor;
};

/**
 * Clamp value within range
 */
export const clamp = (value: number, min: number, max: number): number => {
  return Math.max(min, Math.min(max, value));
};
```

### Performance Considerations
[Source: docs/prd.md#Non-Functional Requirements]

**NFR1:** 60 FPS on desktop (16ms frame time)

**Performance Tips:**
- useFrame runs every frame (60 FPS)
- Lerp calculation is lightweight
- Event listener with passive: false for preventDefault (required to prevent default scroll)
- Monitor with Chrome DevTools Performance tab
- Watch for scroll jank (stuttering during scroll)

### Frame Time Target
[Source: AC 7]

**16ms frame time = 60 FPS:**
- Each frame must complete in under 16.67ms
- Lerp and camera update should be nearly instantaneous
- Monitor with DevTools: Performance > Frame Rate

### Cross-Browser Testing
[Source: docs/ui-architecture.md#Browser & Device Support]

**Target Browsers:**
- Chrome 90+ (primary)
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

**Wheel Event Compatibility:**
- Wheel event supported in all modern browsers
- deltaY property standard across browsers
- preventDefault required to stop page scroll

### Integration with Scene
[Source: Story 1.2 - Scene.tsx]

**Add CameraController to Scene:**
```typescript
// src/components/3d/Scene.tsx

import { CameraController } from './CameraController';

<Canvas camera={{ position: [0, 0, 5], fov: 75 }}>
  <CameraController />
  <Lights />
  {/* Project cards */}
</Canvas>
```

**Note:** CameraController component doesn't render any 3D objects, it only updates camera position via useFrame.

### Testing
**Testing Standards:**
[Source: docs/ui-architecture.md#Testing Requirements]

- Manual testing only for MVP
- Test scroll behavior in all target browsers
- Verify smooth camera movement (no jank)
- Check bounds work correctly (can't scroll too far)
- Monitor performance with DevTools
- No automated tests required

**Key Test Points:**
1. Mouse wheel scrolls camera forward/backward
2. Camera movement is smooth (lerp working)
3. Scroll bounds prevent going too close or too far
4. Y position stays at 0 (maintains focus)
5. Performance maintains 60 FPS during scroll
6. Works in Chrome, Firefox, Safari
7. No scroll jank or dropped frames

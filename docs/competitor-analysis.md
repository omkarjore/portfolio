// Good: Text outside canvas (SEO-friendly)
<div className="hero-section">
  <h1>Omkar Jore - CAD Automation Specialist</h1>
  <p>40% time reduction through smart automation</p>
</div>
<Canvas>
  {/* 3D elements */}
</Canvas>

// Bad: All content in 3D text
<Canvas>
  <Text3D>Omkar Jore</Text3D>
  <Text3D>CAD Automation Specialist</Text3D>
</Canvas>
```

**Accessibility:**
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion (disable animations)
